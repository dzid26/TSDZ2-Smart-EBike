This repository is updated by mbrusa.

This fork is based on the TSDZ2-v0.20beta1 adapted for Tongsheng protocol displays, like stock VLCD5, VLCD6, XH18 or other displays with the same protocol and 6-pin Tonsheng connector, SW102, DZ41 from Enerprof or 850C for TSDZ2.
With these last displays, the visualization of data and errors must be checked..

This ebike motor controller firmware project is to be used with the Tongsheng TSDZ2 mid drive motor.
Note: firmware can't be written to Enerdan sold TSDZ2 motors and controllers because they are equipped with V2 controller and XMC1300 microprocessor instead of STM8.

It has the following benefits compared to the stock firmware:
* The motor runs more efficient therefore it becomes more powerful and consumes less energy.
* The ebike will feel more responsive and agile.
* Using other supported displays and pheriperals will provide more functionality and features.
* Because this project is in heavy development more features will be added.

This project is being developed and maintained for free by a community of users. Some of them are developers who work professionally developing this type of technology for very well known companies.
